x86info grew into a tangled hairball that grew to be too painful to maintain.
x86utils is a more fine-grained version of x86info, with many standalone tools
instead of one single executable with a dozen features.

Patches to davej@redhat.com

Done so far:
- common/ dir for rdmsr/cpuid etc that all executables will need.
- x86mtrr : MTRR register decoder.

TODO:
- x86features : feature flag decoder
- x86cacheinfo : decode the cache cpuid leaves
- x86identify : (what's leftover in x86info after the above).
